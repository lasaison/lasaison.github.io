José learned about coffee production from his father as he grew up, and now he passes that knowledge on to his son, Cláudio Vinicius Pimentel, who is also a coffee grower operating the nearby Sítio Paraguai.\n\nThe farm has proven to have great potential for quality coffee, which has been a continued motivation for investment and improvement. 16 of the property’s 19.5 hectares are planted with coffee, yielding over 600 bags annually. The crops are strictly managed, using as few pesticides as possible, incorporating organic matter material in the process, and striving to preserve the farm’s natural resources.\n\nThis lot of Yellow Catuai coffee underwent Natural processing. Catuai was made by the Instituto Agronomico (IAC) of Sao Paulo State in Campinas, Brazil by crossing Mundo Novo and Caturra varieties. Catuai coffees are cultivated widely across Brazil, and are known for their high productivity potential. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c!-- First row --\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid main_row\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003eTasting notes\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"desc_text\"\u003eHazelnut Praline, Chocolate, Blueberry\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003eRegion\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"desc_text\"\u003eMantiqueira de Minas\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003efarm\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"desc_text\"\u003eSítio São Bartolomeu\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c!-- Second row --\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid main_row\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003eProducer\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"desc_text\"\u003eJose Pimentel\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003eProc.
