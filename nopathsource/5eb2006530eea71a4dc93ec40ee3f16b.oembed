Itâ€™s first roast was a success we thought, we knew we were close, it was juicy and fruity. However the flavours were not yet clear and outspoken enough for us. We knew it was fine but we wanted to get more out of it. One roast would get rid of its astringency, but also its balance. The next roast would bring back its balance but reduce its clarity. It was stubborn but in the end it paid of. When you taste this coffee you will get defined notes of gooseberry, a crisp raspberry acidity and a rounded milk chocolate finish to bring the outspoken fruitiness to a balanced brew \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c!-- First row --\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid main_row\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003eTasting notes\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"desc_text\"\u003eRaspberry, Gooseberry, Black Tea, Milk Choc\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003eRegion\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"desc_text\"\u003eJimma\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003efarm\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"desc_text\"\u003eAmbaru Bulti\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c!-- Second row --\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid main_row\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003eProducer\u003c\/h6\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"desc_text\"\u003eMustefa Abakeno\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"grid__item medium-up--one-half main_col\"\u003e\n\u003ch6 class=\"desc_span\"\u003eProc.
